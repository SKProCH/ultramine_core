## Ultramine 
This is ultramine core fork aimed to work with GT:NH

### Launching GT:NH

Currently you need to do 2 things:
1. Delete `archaicfix` mod from you mods folder
2. Delete `coretweaks` or edit config file `config/coretweaks.cfg` and disable `diagnostics.detect_data_watcher_id_conflicts`:
    ```cfg
    diagnostics {
      detect_data_watcher_id_conflicts {
          # Emit warning when a mod registers a typed DataWatcher object in an already occupied ID slot (vanilla only warns in the typeless registration method). [default: true]
          S:_enabled=false
  
          # Keep track of all registration stack traces, and print which ones conflict. Off by default because it adds some overhead to DataWatcher object registration. [default: false]
          B:detectDataWatcherIdConflictCulprit=false
      }
      enhance_map_storage_errors {
          # Makes MapStorage's errors more informative. [default: true]
          S:_enabled=true
      }
    }
    ```
### Running on modern Java 21

Seems like ultramine can be run on java 21 without any modifications (at least on my private server it runs fine).

Here is how to do it:
1. You need to get `lwjgl3fy-forgePatches` compatible with ultramine
      - Here is compiled version of lwjgl3fy 2.1.4: https://github.com/SKProCH/ultramine_core/releases/download/v0.4/lwjgl3ify-2.1.4-master+ea93d147db-dirty-forgePatches.jar
      - Or you can compile it by yourself from [here](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/lwjgl3ify/)  
        You need to edit `build.gradle.kts` and change `libraryList`
        ```
            manifest {
            val libraryList = listOf(
        ```
        It should include all the libraries from the `libraries` folder, and `"forge-1.7.10-10.13.4.1614-1.7.10-universal.jar", "minecraft_server.1.7.10.jar"` should be replaced to ultramine jar name, like `"ultramine_core-server.jar"`.  
        [Here](https://gist.github.com/SKProCH/b44d24d37b6d07c04d1cd49abf3239dd#file-build-gradle-kts-L164-L229) is the example for current repo.  
        After that use `forgePatchesJar` target.
2. Rename ultramine server core jar to `"ultramine_core-server.jar"` (or whatever name you included to libraryList if you are compiled lwjgl3fy by yourself)
3. Rename `forgePatches` files to `lwjgl3ify-forgePatches.jar`
4. Create a file named `java9args.txt` with the contents of [the file in this repository](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/lwjgl3ify/blob/master/java9args.txt).
5. You can now launch the server with a command like the following, assuming the first java executable on your PATH is java 11/17/newer:
  ```shell
      java -Xmx6G -Xms6G @java9args.txt -jar lwjgl3ify-forgePatches.jar nogui
  ```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure what you downloaded mods for 17-21 java (not the 8 like you do before!).  
> Make sure what you fixed `archaicfix` and `coretweaks` as stated on top.
